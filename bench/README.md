# ITB Fortran Binding - Easy Mode Benchmark

> **Security notice.** ITB is an experimental symmetric cipher construction without prior peer review, independent cryptanalysis, or formal certification. The construction's security properties have **not been verified** by independent cryptographers or mathematicians.
>
> PRF-grade hash functions are **required**. No warranty is provided.

**No bespoke cryptography.** ITB introduces no cryptographic primitive of its own — no custom S-box, permutation, or round function. It is a construction over existing primitives, much as PGP composes standard ciphers rather than defining one. Such constructions are not the object of algorithm-level cryptographic certification: national regimes (NIST CAVP/FIPS in the US, GOST/FSB in Russia, KCMVP in South Korea, OSCCA's SM-series in China, SOG-IS/EUCC and national lists in the EU, ASD's ISM in Australia) certify **primitives** and the **modules** built on them, not compositional schemes. Eligibility for regulated use is therefore inherited from the primitives ITB is configured with, not conferred by ITB itself.

Two executables (`itb-bench-single`, `itb-bench-triple`) cover the
Easy Mode encryption / decryption surface exposed by the Fortran
binding through two `program` units driven by one shared
`bench_common` module:

* `bench_single.f90` -- Single Ouroboros (mode = 1, 3 seeds + optional
  dedicated lockSeed). Walks the nine PRF-grade primitives plus one
  mixed-primitive variant.
* `bench_triple.f90` -- Triple Ouroboros (mode = 3, 7 seeds + optional
  dedicated lockSeed). Same nine + one mixed grid as the Single
  binary.

Both binaries pin **1024-bit ITB key width** and **16 MiB
non-deterministic-fill payload**, run four ops per case
(`e%encrypt`, `e%decrypt`, `e%encrypt_auth`, `e%decrypt_auth`), and
emit a Go-bench-style line per case (`name iters ns/op MB/s`).

The harness is a custom Go-bench-style runner in
`bench_common.f90` (no third-party bench framework -- Fortran's
intrinsic `system_clock` and an inline xorshift64* LCG cover the
timing and random-fill surfaces). One `make bench` invocation
produces both binaries.

## Prerequisites

Build the shared library and confirm a Fortran toolchain is available
(gfortran 13+ or Intel ifx 2024.0+ both build cleanly):

```bash
go build -trimpath -buildmode=c-shared \
    -o dist/linux-amd64/libitb.so ./cmd/cshared
gfortran --version  # or ifx --version
```

A project-private opt-out tag is available when the 4-lane
chain-absorb wrapper is dead weight (hosts without AVX-512+VL). The
tag disables only the chain-absorb asm; upstream stdlib asm stays
engaged so the per-pixel single Func runs at upstream-asm speed via
`process_cgo`'s nil-`BatchHash` fallback:

```bash
go build -trimpath -tags=noitbasm -buildmode=c-shared \
    -o dist/linux-amd64/libitb.so ./cmd/cshared
```

The Fortran binding loads `libitb.so` via the `iso_c_binding`
`bind(C, name="...")` declarations in `src/itb_sys.f90` and resolves
it at run time via the embedded RPATH baked into each bench binary
(`-Wl,-rpath,../../dist/linux-amd64`); see the
`bindings/fortran/Makefile` bench section for the exact link line.

## Run

From the binding root (`bindings/fortran/`):

```bash
./build.sh
make bench
./bench/bin/itb-bench-single
./bench/bin/itb-bench-triple
```

The Makefile compiles each `bench/bench_*.f90` against the shared
`bench/bench_common.f90` and the binding's `build/*.o` src tree,
producing one binary per source under `bench/bin/`. Both binaries
land in `bench/bin/` after a successful `make bench`.

For the canonical four-pass sweep that fills [BENCH.md](BENCH.md),
use the wrapper script in the binding root:

```bash
cd bindings/fortran
make bench
./run_bench.sh                  # full 4-pass canonical sweep
./run_bench.sh single           # passes 1 + 3 (Single Ouroboros only)
./run_bench.sh triple           # passes 2 + 4 (Triple Ouroboros only)
./run_bench.sh --no-lockseed    # passes 1 + 2 only
./run_bench.sh --lockseed-only  # passes 3 + 4 only
```

Pass `FC=ifx` to drive Intel's compiler instead of gfortran:

```bash
FC=ifx make bench
FC=ifx ./run_bench.sh
```

## Environment variables

| Variable             | Default | Purpose |
|----------------------|---------|---------|
| `ITB_NONCE_BITS`     | `128`   | Process-wide nonce width -- `128`, `256`, or `512`. Maps to `itb_set_nonce_bits` before any encryptor is constructed. Mirrors `ITB_NONCE_BITS` from `bitbyte_test.go`. |
| `ITB_LOCKSEED`       | unset   | When set to a non-empty / non-`0` value, every encryptor in the run calls `e%set_lock_seed(1)`. Easy Mode auto-couples `set_bit_soup(1)` + `set_lock_soup(1)`, so no separate flags are needed. The mixed-primitive cases attach a dedicated lockSeed primitive (via `prim_l = "areion256"`) only under this flag; otherwise `prim_l` is omitted so the no-LockSeed bench arm measures the plain mixed-primitive cost. |
| `ITB_BENCH_FILTER`   | unset   | Substring filter on bench-case names -- only cases whose name contains the filter are run. Useful when iterating on one primitive / op. |
| `ITB_BENCH_MIN_SEC`  | `5.0`   | Minimum measured wall-clock seconds per case. The runner keeps doubling iteration count until the measured batch reaches the threshold, mirroring Go's `-benchtime=Ns`. The 5-second default absorbs the cold-cache / warm-up transient that distorts shorter measurement windows on the 16 MiB encrypt / decrypt path. |

Worker count is fixed at `itb_set_max_workers(0)` (auto-detect),
matching the Go bench default.

## Examples

Whole grid, default settings (128-bit nonces, no lockSeed):

```bash
./bench/bin/itb-bench-single
```

512-bit nonces with the dedicated lockSeed channel + auto-coupled
overlay:

```bash
ITB_NONCE_BITS=512 ITB_LOCKSEED=1 ./bench/bin/itb-bench-triple
```

Just the BLAKE3 row of the Single grid:

```bash
ITB_BENCH_FILTER=blake3_1024bit ./bench/bin/itb-bench-single
```

Only the encrypt-with-MAC ops across every primitive in the Triple
grid, with a longer 10-second per-case budget for tighter confidence
intervals:

```bash
ITB_BENCH_FILTER=encrypt_auth_16mb ITB_BENCH_MIN_SEC=10 \
    ./bench/bin/itb-bench-triple
```

Just the mixed-primitive cases on the Single side:

```bash
ITB_BENCH_FILTER=mixed ./bench/bin/itb-bench-single
```

## Output format

```
# easy_single primitives=9 key_bits=1024 mac=hmac-blake3 nonce_bits=128 lockseed=off workers=auto
# benchmarks=40 payload_bytes=16777216 min_seconds=5.000
bench_single_aescmac_1024bit_encrypt_16mb               4    493210110.0 ns/op    32.44 MB/s
bench_single_aescmac_1024bit_decrypt_16mb               4    488104225.0 ns/op    32.78 MB/s
...
```

The four columns are:

1. Bench-case name (matches the `BenchmarkSingle*` /
   `BenchmarkTriple*` Go cohort, snake-cased).
2. Iteration count chosen to reach `ITB_BENCH_MIN_SEC`.
3. Per-iter wall-clock cost in nanoseconds.
4. Throughput in MiB/s, derived from `payload_bytes / ns_per_op`.

Comparison with the Go bench cohort goes via the MB/s column -- the
throughput figure is the most direct cross-language signal for how
much overhead the Fortran binding adds on top of the underlying
libitb call path.

## Expected runtime

At the default `ITB_BENCH_MIN_SEC=5`, each pass walks 40 cases (9
single-primitive + 1 mixed x 4 ops) and converges per case in 5-15
wall-clock seconds depending on the primitive's per-byte cost. A
full pass therefore lands at 5-10 minutes; the four canonical passes
(Single +/- LockSeed, Triple +/- LockSeed) fill BENCH.md in
~30-60 minutes of total wall-clock time per compiler. Filter to a
single primitive (`ITB_BENCH_FILTER=blake3_1024bit`) for ~1-minute
spot-check runs.

## Recorded results

A snapshot of the four canonical pass results (Single + Triple, each
with and without `ITB_LOCKSEED=1`) on Intel Core i7-11700K is
collected in [BENCH.md](BENCH.md). The same file briefly discusses
the FFI overhead the binding leaves on top of the native Go path
through the `iso_c_binding` `bind(C, name="...")` declarations the
binding's `itb_sys.f90` uses for every libitb FFI symbol. Pointer
back to the binding's top-level [README.md](../README.md) for the
broader Easy Mode surface documentation.
