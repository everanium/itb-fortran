# ITB Format-Deniability Wrapper — Fortran Binding

> **Security notice.** ITB is an experimental symmetric cipher construction without prior peer review, independent cryptanalysis, or formal certification. The construction's security properties have **not been verified** by independent cryptographers or mathematicians.

**No bespoke cryptography.** ITB introduces no cryptographic primitive of its own — no custom S-box, permutation, or round function. It is a construction over existing primitives, much as PGP composes standard ciphers rather than defining one. Such constructions are not the object of algorithm-level cryptographic certification: national regimes (NIST CAVP/FIPS in the US, GOST/FSB in Russia, KCMVP in South Korea, OSCCA's SM-series in China, SOG-IS/EUCC and national lists in the EU, ASD's ISM in Australia) certify **primitives** and the **modules** built on them, not compositional schemes. Eligibility for regulated use is therefore inherited from the primitives ITB is configured with, not conferred by ITB itself.

Fortran-idiomatic surface over the 12 `ITB_Wrap*` / `ITB_Unwrap*` / `ITB_WrapStream*` / `ITB_UnwrapStream*` / `ITB_WrapperKeySize` / `ITB_WrapperNonceSize` exports in `cmd/cshared/main.go`. Wraps an ITB ciphertext under one of outer keystream ciphers, each in CTR mode, so the on-wire bytes carry no ITB-specific format pattern (W / H / container layout for Non-AEAD; 32-byte stream-id prefix + per-chunk metadata for Streaming AEAD). The wrap exists for **format-deniability ONLY** — ITB already provides content-deniability and the AEAD path already provides integrity.

## Threat model

ITB encrypts content into RGBWYOPA pixel containers. The construction provides **content-deniability** unconditionally — no plaintext bit can be extracted from the wire. The wire pattern itself, however, is parseable by an observer who knows the ITB format:

- Non-AEAD path: per-chunk header carries width / height / container layout.
- Streaming AEAD path: a once per-stream 32-byte stream-id prefix plus per-chunk `nonce || W || H || container || flag_byte`.

A passive observer who knows ITB ships with an 8-channel pixel container and a 32-byte stream-id prefix can pattern-match the bytes. The format-deniability wrap hides that surface under a generic outer cipher in CTR mode. After wrapping, the wire is `nonce || keystream-XOR(bytestream)` — the same shape used by countless other protocols. An observer sees a small leading nonce followed by pseudorandom-looking bytes; pattern-matching does not distinguish ITB from any other stream cipher payload.

This is **not** a random-oracle indistinguishability claim. It is a "looks like a different well-known cipher" claim. The wrap exists for format-deniability ONLY; ITB already provides confidentiality (content-deniability) and the AEAD path already provides per-stream and per-chunk integrity. The Non-AEAD streaming path has no integrity by design and the wrap does not add any.

## Wrapper API

The Fortran binding exposes the wrap surface through the `itb_wrapper` module under `bindings/fortran/src/itb_wrapper.f90`. Three flavours of helpers, picked per use case:

| Helper | Wire format | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| `itb_wrap` / `itb_unwrap` | `nonce` + keystream-XOR(blob) | Single Message Encrypt / EncryptAuth output (separately allocated wire buffer) |
| `itb_wrap_in_place` / `itb_unwrap_in_place` | `nonce` separate, body XORed in place | no output-buffer allocation on the hot path; mutates the caller's blob / wire |
| `itb_wrap_stream_writer_t` / `itb_unwrap_stream_reader_t` | `nonce` + keystream-XOR(continuous bytestream) | streaming use — Streaming AEAD IO-Driven, or User-Driven Loop where caller-side framing (e.g. per-chunk `u32_LE` length prefixes) is written through the wrap-writer so the framing bytes also pass through the keystream XOR |

The single keystream advances monotonically across all bytes within one wrap session. A fresh CSPRNG nonce is generated per session; emitted once at stream start; never reused across sessions. This is standard CTR mode usage — within one stream, one nonce + counter is correct.

No length-prefix or other framing byte appears in cleartext on the wire in any wrap shape. The User-Driven Loop emits length prefixes through the wrap-writer so they get XORed into the keystream alongside the chunk bodies.

## Outer ciphers

| Cipher | Constant | FFI name | Key | Nonce | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Areion-SoEM-256 in CTR mode | `ITB_WRAPPER_CIPHER_AREION_256` | `"areion256"` | 32 B | 16 B | AES-round-based PRF in CTR mode. Sound under standard PRF assumption. |
| Areion-SoEM-512 in CTR mode | `ITB_WRAPPER_CIPHER_AREION_512` | `"areion512"` | 64 B | 16 B | Wider Areion PRF in CTR mode. Sound under standard PRF assumption. |
| BLAKE2b-256 in CTR mode | `ITB_WRAPPER_CIPHER_BLAKE2B_256` | `"blake2b256"` | 32 B | 16 B | Keyed BLAKE2b PRF in CTR mode. Sound under standard PRF assumption. |
| BLAKE2b-512 in CTR mode | `ITB_WRAPPER_CIPHER_BLAKE2B_512` | `"blake2b512"` | 32 B | 16 B | Keyed BLAKE2b PRF (512-bit output) in CTR mode. Sound under standard PRF assumption. |
| BLAKE2s in CTR mode | `ITB_WRAPPER_CIPHER_BLAKE2S` | `"blake2s"` | 32 B | 16 B | Keyed BLAKE2s PRF in CTR mode. Sound under standard PRF assumption. |
| BLAKE3 in CTR mode | `ITB_WRAPPER_CIPHER_BLAKE3` | `"blake3"` | 32 B | 16 B | Keyed BLAKE3 PRF in CTR mode. Sound under standard PRF assumption. |
| AES-128-CTR | `ITB_WRAPPER_CIPHER_AES_128_CTR` | `"aescmac"` | 16 B | 16 B | stdlib `crypto/aes` + `crypto/cipher.NewCTR`. AES-NI accelerated. |
| SipHash-2-4 in CTR mode | `ITB_WRAPPER_CIPHER_SIPHASH24` | `"siphash24"` | 16 B | 16 B | `github.com/dchest/siphash` PRF. Custom CTR construction; sound under standard PRF assumption. |
| ChaCha20 (RFC 8439) | `ITB_WRAPPER_CIPHER_CHACHA20` | `"chacha20"` | 32 B | 12 B | `golang.org/x/crypto/chacha20`. No AES-NI dependency. |

The SipHash-CTR construction:
- 16-byte SipHash key = wrapper key.
- 16-byte nonce split into `(nonce_hi, nonce_lo)` 64-bit halves.
- Each keystream block: `siphash.Hash128(key, nonce_hi || (nonce_lo XOR counter_LE))` — 16-byte output, XORed with plaintext.
- Counter increments per block; nonce stays fixed for the stream.

## Quick Start

The eitb runner under `bindings/fortran/eitb/eitb.f90` exercises every example × cipher combination end-to-end. Build and run:

```sh
make eitb
./eitb/bin/eitb              # 72 PASS, 0 FAIL
```

Eight examples cover the full streaming + Single Message matrix. The Fortran binding has **no Streaming No MAC IO-Driven** examples (there is no unit-IO analogue for Non-AEAD streaming); the No MAC streaming arm uses the User-Driven Loop only.

### 1. Streaming AEAD Easy (MAC Authenticated, IO-Driven)

ITB Call: `itb_encryptor_stream_encrypt_auth` / `itb_encryptor_stream_decrypt_auth` over caller-supplied `read_fn` / `write_fn` callbacks. Wrap shape: one `itb_wrap_stream_writer_t` session over the entire bytestream the inner stream encoder emits.

```fortran
type(itb_encryptor_t)            :: enc
type(itb_wrap_stream_writer_t)   :: ww
integer(itb_byte_kind), allocatable :: outer_key(:), nonce(:)

call new_itb_encryptor(enc, "areion512", 1024, "hmac-blake3", 1)
call enc%set_nonce_bits(128); call enc%set_barrier_fill(4)
call enc%set_bit_soup(1);     call enc%set_lock_soup(1)
call enc%set_lock_batch(1)    ! Recommended under the PRF assumption,
                              ! the performance Lock Soup mode.
                              ! Symmetric, set on both sides.

call itb_wrapper_generate_key(ITB_WRAPPER_CIPHER_AES_128_CTR, outer_key, rc)

! Sender: encrypt to in-memory sink, then wrap end-to-end.
call itb_encryptor_stream_encrypt_auth(enc, rfn, c_loc(src_pt),                &
                                        wfn, c_loc(sink_inner),                 &
                                        chunk_size, rc)

call itb_wrap_stream_writer_new(ITB_WRAPPER_CIPHER_AES_128_CTR, outer_key, ww, &
                                  nonce, rc)
call ww%update(inner_buf, wire_body, rc)
call ww%destroy()
```

### 2. Streaming AEAD Low-Level (MAC Authenticated, IO-Driven)

ITB Call: `itb_stream_encrypt_auth` / `itb_stream_decrypt_auth` with three explicit `itb_seed_t` handles + an HMAC-BLAKE3 `itb_mac_t`. Wrap shape: as above.

### 3. Streaming Easy (No MAC, User-Driven Loop)

The Go README's "Alternative — User-Driven Loop" pattern: each chunk is one independent `enc%encrypt(buf)` call. Wrap shape: `itb_wrap_stream_writer_t` driven by a caller loop that emits `u32_LE_len || ct` per chunk through the wrap-writer. Length prefix and chunk body both pass through the keystream XOR — no length appears in cleartext on the wire.

### 4. Streaming Low-Level (No MAC, User-Driven Loop)

Per-chunk `itb_encrypt` / `itb_decrypt` with caller-side framing. Wrap shape as in example 3.

### 5. Easy: Areion-SoEM-512 (No MAC, Single Message)

ITB Call: `enc%encrypt(plaintext)` returns one ITB blob. Wrap shape: `itb_wrap_in_place` mutates the blob and emits the per-stream nonce; the caller composes `nonce || mutated_blob` to produce the wire. Receiver `itb_unwrap_in_place` mutates the wire and returns the body-first index for the decrypted-payload slice.

```fortran
integer(itb_byte_kind), allocatable, target :: encrypted(:), wire(:), nonce(:)
integer :: nlen, body_first

encrypted = enc%encrypt(plaintext)

call itb_wrap_in_place(ITB_WRAPPER_CIPHER_AES_128_CTR, outer_key,              &
                        encrypted, nonce, rc)
nlen = size(nonce)
allocate (wire(nlen + size(encrypted)))
wire(1:nlen) = nonce(:)
wire(nlen + 1 : nlen + size(encrypted)) = encrypted(:)

! Receiver.
call itb_unwrap_in_place(ITB_WRAPPER_CIPHER_AES_128_CTR, outer_key,            &
                          wire, body_first, rc)
plaintext = enc%decrypt(wire(body_first : size(wire)))
```

The immutable-input alternative uses `itb_wrap` / `itb_unwrap`, which allocate a fresh wire buffer at the cost of one extra allocation per call. The eitb runner exercises both via commented alternatives.

### 6. Easy: Areion-SoEM-512 + HMAC-BLAKE3 (MAC Authenticated, Single Message)

ITB Call: `enc%encrypt_auth` / `enc%decrypt_auth`. Wrap shape: as in example 5. The ITB-internal 32-byte MAC tag remains inside the RGBWYOPA container; outer cipher is format-deniability only.

### 7. Low-Level: Areion-SoEM-512 (No MAC, Single Message)

ITB Call: `itb_encrypt(noise, data, start, plaintext)` / `itb_decrypt(...)` with three explicit `itb_seed_t` handles built from `new_itb_seed("areion512", 2048)`. Wrap shape as in example 5.

### 8. Low-Level: Areion-SoEM-512 + HMAC-BLAKE3 (MAC Authenticated, Single Message)

ITB Call: `itb_encrypt_auth` / `itb_decrypt_auth` with the MAC handle constructed via `new_itb_mac(mac, "hmac-blake3", mac_key)`. Wrap shape as in example 5.

## Verification matrix

Every example × cipher combination round-trips against random plaintext (1 KiB for Single Message, 64 KiB for streaming) with sha256 byte-equality. Sample run:

```
[PASS] aead-easy-io              + areion256   pt=65536 wire=90016
[PASS] aead-easy-io              + areion512   pt=65536 wire=90016
[PASS] aead-easy-io              + blake2b256   pt=65536 wire=90016
[PASS] aead-easy-io              + blake2b512   pt=65536 wire=90016

[PASS] aead-easy-io              + siphash24   pt=65536 wire=90016
[PASS] aead-easy-io              + chacha20    pt=65536 wire=90012
...
[PASS] message-lowlevel-auth     + areion256   pt=1024 wire=8228
[PASS] message-lowlevel-auth     + areion512   pt=1024 wire=8228
[PASS] message-lowlevel-auth     + blake2b256   pt=1024 wire=8228
[PASS] message-lowlevel-auth     + blake2b512   pt=1024 wire=8228
[PASS] message-lowlevel-auth     + blake2s     pt=1024 wire=8228
[PASS] message-lowlevel-auth     + blake3      pt=1024 wire=8228
[PASS] message-lowlevel-auth     + aescmac     pt=1024 wire=8228
[PASS] message-lowlevel-auth     + siphash24   pt=1024 wire=8228
[PASS] message-lowlevel-auth     + chacha20    pt=1024 wire=8224
```

The wire-byte difference between cipher columns is exactly the per-stream nonce-size delta (12 bytes for ChaCha20, 16 bytes for every other outer cipher); the User-Driven Loop variants additionally include 4 bytes of keystream-XORed length prefix per chunk.

## Performance

Bench numbers across Single Ouroboros and Triple Ouroboros, message and streaming, encrypt and decrypt (split sub-benches) are tracked in [BENCH.md](BENCH.md). Total sub-bench count: 102 (6 wrapper only round-trip + 24 Message Single + 24 Message Triple + 24 Streaming Single + 24 Streaming Triple).

## Notes on outer cipher key management

The wrapper itself does not address outer key distribution; the eitb runner generates a fresh CSPRNG outer key per run for self-test purposes. In a real deployment the outer key is shared out-of-band (or derived via a separate key-exchange step) and is independent of the ITB seed material. The ITB state blob already carries the inner cipher's keying material; the outer key is the additional piece both endpoints need.

The outer key MAY be reused across many streams provided each stream uses a fresh CSPRNG nonce — this is the standard CTR mode safety contract. The wrapper helpers always generate a fresh nonce internally, so caller-side discipline is reduced to "do not reuse the same `(key, nonce)` across distinct streams" — a contract the helper enforces by construction.

## Threading

The Single Message `itb_wrap` / `itb_unwrap` / `itb_wrap_in_place` / `itb_unwrap_in_place` are thread-safe: each call constructs an outer cipher session of its own and the libitb keystream constructor draws a fresh CSPRNG nonce per call. The streaming `itb_wrap_stream_writer_t` / `itb_unwrap_stream_reader_t` handles are single-feeder — every `update` call advances the underlying keystream counter; concurrent `update` calls on the same handle race. Distinct handles run independently.

## What this is not

- Not an integrity layer. The outer cipher is unauthenticated by design — adding a MAC at this layer would defeat the format-deniability goal (the resulting wire would pattern-match an AEAD construction's tag-bearing format, not a generic stream cipher). Use the ITB AEAD path when integrity is required.
- Not a substitute for ITB's content-deniability. ITB still provides the unconditional content-deniability; the wrap adds format-deniability on top.
